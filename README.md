Public sharing of the source for my [Ludum Dare #27 entry](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-27/?action=preview&uid=18719).

Disclaimer: this was made in 48h, and the only changes made after that are porting to newer versions of unity and fixing game-breaking bugs (you can check the commit history). Therefore, the code is not in the best shape.
